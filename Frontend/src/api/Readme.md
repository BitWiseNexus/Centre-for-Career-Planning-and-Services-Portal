# API Services

This directory contains service files responsible for making HTTP requests to the backend API. Each service corresponds to a specific domain or module of the application (e.g., user, job, authentication). Focuses on direct interaction with the backend APIs. It's concerned with making HTTP requests and returning data, often without much additional logic.
