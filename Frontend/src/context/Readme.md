# Context Directory

This folder contains files related to global state management using React's Context API or Redux. It allows the application to manage state that needs to be shared across multiple components.

## Structure

- **/AuthContext.jsx**: Manages user authentication state across the application.
- **/JobContext.jsx**: Manages state related to job listings, filtering, and applications.
- **/GlobalContext.jsx**: Any other global state that doesnâ€™t fit into specific contexts.
